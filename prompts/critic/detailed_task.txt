Given the brief task description, please turn it into feasible, detailed task description that can help your fellow reward function engineer to think deeper. You may implement the CoT(Chain of Though), advanced RL training technique(curiosity driven, sparse/dense reward), and set up the scene by words: start from (0,0,1), go straight to (something), and finally (something). If the task is hovering, then the official code is the baseline, your fellow should perform better than the official score.
