### What you must do:

Return me the code of functions with few or no comments, you need to make sure you have completed all functions according to the requirement without any omission, meaning that you should output runnable codes and not just comments waiting for completion by human, such that the code can run without error.

For the self.episode_sums, please faithfully only use the following episode dict
# log episode reward sums
        self.episode_sums["rew_pos"] += pos_reward
        self.episode_sums["rew_orient"] += up_reward
        self.episode_sums["rew_effort"] += effort_reward
        self.episode_sums["rew_spin"] += spin_reward

        # log raw info
        self.episode_sums["raw_dist"] += target_dist
        self.episode_sums["raw_orient"] += ups[..., 2]
        self.episode_sums["raw_effort"] += effort
        self.episode_sums["raw_spin"] += spin

self.target_dist
self.xxx
These variables used in the is_done function must be defined in calculate_metrics function
See under what circumstance you will be heavily punished in {If you output anything like the following, I will punish you and will not pay for that} sector.
### If you output anything like the following, I will punish you and will not pay for that:

```python
    # Problems: 1. You don't need to return this function at all; 2. Funtions are poorly written and contains not runable trash
    def set_up_scene(self, scene):
        # Example: Add Crazyflie and target to the scene
        self.get_crazyflie()
        self.get_target()
        # Add more scene setup steps here

    def initialize_views(self, scene):
        # Example: Initialize views for the Crazyflie and target for rendering or observation extraction
        # This might be specific to how your simulation framework handles viewports and sensors

    def get_crazyflie(self):
        # Example: Instantiate Crazyflie drone within the environment
        # Specific instantiation details depend on the simulation framework

    def get_target(self):
        # Example: Place a target object in the environment for the Crazyflie to interact with or move towards

    def get_observations(self):
        # Example: Collect and return current environmental observations relevant to the task
        # Could include drone state, target position, obstacles, etc.

    def pre_physics_step(self, actions):
        # Process actions received from the neural network and apply to the drone
        # This might involve converting action values to thrusts, rotations, etc.

    def post_reset(self):
        # Reset task-specific elements and prepare for a new episode
        # This could involve repositioning the drone, resetting the target, etc.

```
Also, the following cause error here: Reintroduce class
ensure no "class" or "__init__" is included in your output
```python
 # New Code Starts Here
    
    import math
    import numpy as np
    import torch
    from omni.isaac.core.utils.torch.rotations import *
    EPS = 1e-6  # small constant to avoid divisions by 0 and log(0)
    
    
    class CrazyflieTask(RLTask): 
        # Function that you newly created for calculation
```
You should check whether your variables in is_done function is linked with self.variable, and you assign variable to the self.variable in the calculate_metrics part 
If not: e.g. AttributeError: 'CrazyflieTask' object has no attribute 'target_dist'. It means you forget to link a variable with self.variable. Every time in your is_done function you use a variable, first is to ensure it is with self, second is that in previous functions you have already store it with self.
Also, I encourage you to not to make much comments after the code, we need to save tokens
