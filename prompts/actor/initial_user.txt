Your fellow now give you the following task: {optimized_task_description} Write a reward function for it. Remember, your fellow decides your payment.
You may refer to Human code difference as a runnable prototype for the task, however, if you think using this technique will ruin the diversity and randomness of the training, you may find another way out, I will pay you for your extra thought.{human_code_diff} 
You have additional resources, which you're encouraged to follow and learn:
