### If you output anything like the following, I will punish you and will not pay for that:

```Python
    def set_up_scene(self, scene):
        # Example: Add Crazyflie and target to the scene
        self.get_crazyflie()
        self.get_target()
        # Add more scene setup steps here

    def initialize_views(self, scene):
        # Example: Initialize views for the Crazyflie and target for rendering or observation extraction
        # This might be specific to how your simulation framework handles viewports and sensors

    def get_crazyflie(self):
        # Example: Instantiate Crazyflie drone within the environment
        # Specific instantiation details depend on the simulation framework

    def get_target(self):
        # Example: Place a target object in the environment for the Crazyflie to interact with or move towards

    def get_observations(self):
        # Example: Collect and return current environmental observations relevant to the task
        # Could include drone state, target position, obstacles, etc.

    def pre_physics_step(self, actions):
        # Process actions received from the neural network and apply to the drone
        # This might involve converting action values to thrusts, rotations, etc.

    def post_reset(self):
        # Reset task-specific elements and prepare for a new episode
        # This could involve repositioning the drone, resetting the target, etc.
