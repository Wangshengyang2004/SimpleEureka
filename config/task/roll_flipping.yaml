description: "A drone starts from (0, 0, 1) will fly to (0, 0, 3) first. Then it should learn to perform a roll-axis flip, not a yaw or pitch axis one, useless spinning is prohibited. When perform roll_flipping, the drone should roll 360 degrees around its roll axis and go for the next stage, landing. In the third stage it will land to (0, 0, 1), then it's done. You may use curiosity method to help drone remember the flipping action. The die condition shouldn't include orient_z is < 0, as during flipping the orient_z could be < 0. The orient_z must be < 0 then a success flipping can take place, otherwise the drone can only reach 90 degree to the ground but never flip over it"
