description: "A drone starts from (0, 0, 1) will fly to (0, 0, 3) first. Then it should learn to perform a roll-axis flip, not a yaw or pitch axis one, useless spinning is prohibited. When perform roll_flipping, the drone should roll 360 degrees around its roll axis and go for the next stage, landing. In the third stage it will land to (0, 0, 1), then it's done. You may use curiosity method to help drone remember the flipping action."
