description: "A Drone needs to flip twice. After two flipping, drone should be at the same point it starts. Two flips don't require certain axis like pitch, yaw, etc. It can be any axis. Even the diagonal axis. Please ensure the reward engineer doesn't add any hover point. The drone should not hover at any point. One good example is the drone heavily favour flexibility, we can sacrifice some stabilities."
